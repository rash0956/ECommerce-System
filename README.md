# ECommerce-System
This website was created by me for the final project of web development course, which is an open online course of the University of Moratuwa, under the "Trainee- Full Stack Developer" program. HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages were used to create it.

This website is an e-commerce website. The frontend here is a combination of black and red colors. There are several sections like home section, about section, product section, review section and contact section.

Here a responsive working JavaScript Cart has been created for the product section. You can add and remove item to cart, you can increase and decrease item size with size change, total will change automatically. If you try to add the same item to the cart you will see the warning box.
